### Summary:
The way that this game was structured was that it uses bootstrap for the general layout in html. So, creating the grid/tiles was easily accessibile and made. With that being said adding the extra stuff like a player option was the next step. Adding the player option I decided to go with a start button to make sure that the choice was actually picked. So once an option for the player is picked, then start is clicked the board wil be playable.

On the main frame I added a a tips button next tot he start button incase somebodys have a few issues with the board setup. The tips button is pretty simple, it directs people to an aleart which has about 6 tips to help along. On top of the main frame we have our title, game edition,  my name/z and then main game frame with a drop in reset button. You'll also see a "Select X or O then Press Start" area which will turn out to be our next player turn area after everything is selected. To the left side we have our status bar with a transparent background to match our css and make it pretty. In this status bar we have our player score, computer score, tie score and game result on who won. 

The computer will have a random chance based on a randomnumber function to go first. You'll be notified once that do happen. The fish in the background was implemented as a sentient web boss fish, so a computer boss who you're going aganist.
